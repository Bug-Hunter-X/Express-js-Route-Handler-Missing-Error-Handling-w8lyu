# Express.js Route Handler Missing Error Handling

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers: the lack of proper error handling for invalid input.  The example shows a route that fetches a user by ID.  If the ID is not a valid number, the application will crash or return unexpected results.

The `bug.js` file contains the buggy code, while `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version with robust error handling.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the directory.
3. Run `node bug.js`. 
4. Send a request with an invalid user ID (e.g., a string or a negative number). 

## Solution

The solution is to add proper error handling to the route handler.  This includes:

* Input validation: Check that the user ID is a number.
* Handling of missing users:  Return a 404 status code if the user is not found.
* Catching and handling exceptions:  Use a try-catch block to handle any errors gracefully. 

The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates these improvements.
